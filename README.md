# Textual Analysis for Automated Phrase Correction (TAAPC)

Implemented a collection of Map Reduce jobs to parse text from a collection of books and compute the probability of each word’s occurring antecedent to each of the other words in the sentence. The application uses the extracted knowledge to correct a given sentence by removing, adding, or changing the order of words.

**cs455.BigramCreator**
 It is a mapReduce job that create bigrams  from text read from a collection of books.
 
**cs455.ProbabilityCalculator**
It is a mapReduce job that uses the created bigrams to computes the probability of each word’s occurring antecedent to each of the other words.

**cs455.AddMissingWord**
It is a mapReduce job that uses the computed probabilities to find the position of the missed word and then finds the word that fits in.

**cs455.AddMissingWord**
It is a mapReduce job that uses the computed probabilities to find the position of the missed word and then finds the word that fits in.

**cs455.RemoveRedundantWord**
It is a mapReduce job that uses the computed probabilities to find the word with minimum probability  and then remove it from the sentewnce.

**Swapping two words in a sentance**
Both (cs455.RemoveRedundantWord, s455.RemoveRedundantWord) can be used to find the words in the wrong positions and then swap them to their right positions.


### Scripts to run the jobs
Currently, we have 2 scripts: **asg4AddExec.sh** cleans old outputs and performs **cs455.AddMissingWord** to add the missing word. and **asg4RemoveExec.sh** cleans old outputs and performs **cs455.RemoveRedundantWord** job to remove one word from the sentence.
